# Summary

`mieshah` is a Python package to assist scientific community who deal with light scattering from spherical particles of various sizes or distribution of particles. It uses Mie theory calculations and the command sets are very easy to use.   

Primarily it will help those research community who deal with light scattering from atmospheric dust, water droplets, and particles.


# Statement of Need

There are several Mie theory python packages available on Github or PyPi. However they often do not give accurate calculation results when compared to previously published results. In addition, it is good to have multiple packages on a given subject using different algorithms so as to compare their results, and also their unique usability may fit better for a given task. The `mieshah` package discussed here is based on a widely used FORTRAN code originally published by [@Shah1977]. This code have been used by several authors including [@Sen1991;@Das2004] in their light scattering calculations from cometary dust. The FORTRAN code have been converted into a Python code and by introducing `mieshah` class and it has been made user friendly to make the user codes as concise as possible. A user can easily calculate parameters like Extinction efficiency, Scattering efficiency, Albedo, etc. and plot graphs for degree of linear polarisation or phase function against the scattering angle with only a small piece of code.      

`mieshah` addresses these issues by providing:

- A comprehensive and reliable Mie calculator.
- Supports easy calculation for single particle or particle size distribution with a single command.
- Generates output as both files and Python variables so that the output persists even after the termination of the program. 
- Polarization, Phase function, etc. are stored in a `list` type variable so that they can be easily plotted by `matplotlib` package.

Above characteristics distinguish this package from other Mie packages for Python and makes it useful for research purpose.

# Mie theory
In every Mie theory code there are mainly three basic input parameters 
- Particle radius
- Wavelength of light
- Complex refractive index 
The last parameter is a complex number where the real part gives the refractive index of the medium whereas the imaginary part is the absorption coefficient.

With these three basic parameters in hand, we can calculate the light scattering results for the particle at scattering angles (Î¸) ranging from 0 to 180 degree. 

To calculate light scattering from an ensemble of particles with a range of particle diameters, we can give a Particle Size Distribution (PSD) function directly as a property for the created object in `mieshah`. 

Details of output parameters are given in the documentation page in the github (https://github.com/DwaipayanDeb/mieshah/tree/main/docs). 

# Accuracy of results
Here we compare `mieshah` results on the basis of a previously published data with two well-known Mie packages - `miepython` and `PyMieScatt`. The phase function data for an isotropic and spherical particle with size parameter X=100 and complex refractive index m=1.5+0.0j are reproduced from Fig-5.7a of [@Hapke2005]. Figures 2 & 3 compares this with `miepython` and `PyMieScatt` results for the same. Although there are similarity, but in some places they differ significantly (The height mismatch along Y direction however are due to different scaling standards of phase function and can be ignored but the nature of the curves). However, `mieshah` results are quite promisingly similar that shows its accuracy of calculation (Figure 4). Relevant Python codes are given in the github project at the `/main/mieshah/TEST/compare/` folder. It can be seen from the codes that `mieshah` also provides a more concise code as compared to other two packages for the same task.

# Installation

You can install the stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install mieshah
```

Or install the latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/DwaipayanDeb/mieshah
```
# Dependencies

This package needs following three packages to be pre-installed on a computer before use: `numpy`, `sympy`, and `dimpy`.

# Usage

An example to use this package 

```python
import mieshah as ms
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# ps-> particle radius(microns), wl-> wavelength (microns), m-> complex refractive index (real,imaginary), 
# f-> size distribution function, incr-> increment for size distribution function
mymie = ms.miescatter(ps=[0.1,1], wl=6.283185307,m=(1.5,0),f="x**-2",incr=0.01)  # With size distribution function
#mymie = ms.miescatter(ps=100, wl=6.283185307,m=(1.5,0.0)) # Without size distribution function (single particle)

print(mymie.ps)
print(mymie.wl)
print(mymie.m)
print(mymie.f)
print(mymie.X) # Size parameter
print(mymie.ALBED) # Albedo
print(mymie.QSCA) # Scattering efficiency
print(mymie.QEXT) # Extinction efficiency
print(mymie.QBAK) # Backscattering efficiency
print(mymie.QABS) # Absorption efficiency
print(mymie.QPR) # Radiation pressure efficiency
print(mymie.I_perp) # Intensity perpendicular to the plane of incidence
print(mymie.I_parl) # Intensity parallel to the plane of incidence
print(mymie.Polar) # Degree of linear polarization
print(mymie.p_theta) # Phase function
print(mymie.theta) # Scattering angle in degrees

plt.plot(mymie.theta[::2], mymie.Polar[::2])
plt.xlabel('Theta (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Polarization')
plt.title('Degree of Linear Polarization')
plt.show()
plt.plot(mymie.theta[::2], mymie.p_theta[::2])
plt.yscale('log')    
plt.xlabel('Theta (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Phase Function')
plt.title('Phase Function')
plt.show()
```
